                    argument of None) when the object is ready to be used.
                    It is not guaranteed to fire by the time the enclosing
                    top-level object has finished deserializing.
         (d1, d2): the object cannot yet be referenced, and even if it could
                   be, it would not yet be ready for use. Any potential users
                   should wait until both deferreds fire before using it.

        The first deferred (d1) is guaranteed to fire before the top-most
        enclosing object (a CallUnslicer, for PB methods) is closed. (if it
        does not fire, that indicates a broken cycle). It is present to

        Mutable containers *must* return a reference to an object (even if
        it is not yet ready to be used, because it contains placeholders to
        tuples that have not yet been created), otherwise those cycles
        cannot be broken and the object graph will not reconstructable.

        The second (d2) has no such guarantees about when it will fire. It
        indicates a dependence upon 'slow' external events. The first use
        case for such 'slow' objects is a globally-referenceable object
        which requires a new Broker connection before it can be used, so the
        Deferred will not fire until a TCP connection has been established
