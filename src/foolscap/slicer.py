        # the assumption that the object graph remains unmodified until
        # serialization is complete. In particular, we assume that all the
        # objects in it remain alive, and no new objects are added to it,
        # until serialization is complete. id(obj) is only unique for live
        # objects: once the object is garbage-collected, a new object may be
        # created with the same id(obj) value.
        #
        # The concern is that a custom Slicer will call something that
        # mutates the object graph before it has finished being serialized.
        # This might be one which calls some user-level function during
        # Slicing, or one which uses a Deferred to put off serialization for
        # a while, creating an opportunity for some other code to get
        # control.

        # The specific concern is that if, in the middle of serialization, an
        # object that was already serialized is gc'ed, and a new object is
        # created and attached to a portion of the object graph that hasn't
        # been serialized yet, and if the new object gets the same id(obj) as
        # the dead object, then we could be tricked into sending the
        # reference number of the old (dead) object. On the receiving end,
        # this would result in a mangled object graph.

        # User code isn't supposed to allow the object graph to change during
        # serialization, so this mangling "should not happen" under normal
        # circumstances. However, as a reasonably cheap way to mitigate the
        # worst sort of mangling when user code *does* mess up,
        # self.references maps from id(obj) to a tuple of (obj,refid) instead
        # of just the refid. This insures that the object will stay alive
        # until the ScopedSlicer dies, guaranteeing that we won't get
        # duplicate id(obj) values. If user code mutates the object graph
        # during serialization we might still get inconsistent results, but
        # they'll be the ordinary kind of inconsistent results (snapshots of
        # different branches of the object graph at different points in time)
