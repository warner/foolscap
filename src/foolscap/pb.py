    or setServiceParent() me to a running service.

    This is the primary entry point for all PB-using applications, both
    clients and servers.

    I am known to the outside world by a base URL, which may include
    authentication information (a yURL). This is my 'TubID'.

    I contain Referenceables, and manage RemoteReferences to Referenceables
    that live in other Tubs.


    @param certData: if provided, use it as a certificate rather than
                     generating a new one. This is a PEM-encoded
                     private/public keypair, as returned by Tub.getCertData()

    @param certFile: if provided, the Tub will store its certificate in
                     this file. If the file does not exist when the Tub is
                     created, the Tub will generate a new certificate and
                     store it here. If the file does exist, the certificate
                     will be loaded from this file.

                     The simplest way to use the Tub is to choose a long-term
                     location for the certificate, use certFile= to tell the
                     Tub about it, and then let the Tub manage its own
                     certificate.

        When remote systems pass a FURL to their Tub.getReference(), our Tub
        will be asked to locate a Referenceable for the name inside that
        furl. The normal mechanism for this is to look at the table
        maintained by registerReference() and unregisterReference(). If the
        name does not exist in that table, other 'lookup handler' functions
        are given a chance. Each lookup handler is asked in turn, and the
        first which returns a non-None value wins.

        This may be useful for cases where the furl represents an object that
        lives on disk, or is generated on demand: rather than creating all
        possible Referenceables at startup, the lookup handler can create or
        retrieve the objects only when someone asks for them.

        Note that constructing the FURLs of these objects may be non-trivial.
        It is safe to create an object, use tub.registerReference in one
        invocation of a program to obtain (and publish) the furl, parse the
        furl to extract the name, save the contents of the object on disk,
        then in a later invocation of the program use a lookup handler to
        retrieve the object from disk. This approach means the objects that
        are created in a given invocation stick around (inside
        tub.strongReferences) for the rest of that invocation. An alternatve
        approach is to create the object but *not* use tub.registerReference,
        but in that case you have to construct the FURL yourself, and the Tub
        does not currently provide any support for doing this robustly.
