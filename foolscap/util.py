    in a more convenient fashion.

    Create me with a list of Deferreds. I will fire my callback (with None)
    if and when all of my component Deferreds fire successfully. I will fire
    my errback when and if any of my component Deferreds errbacks, in which
    case I will absorb the failure. If a second Deferred errbacks, I will not
    absorb that failure.

    This means that you can put a bunch of Deferreds together into an
    AsyncAND and then forget about them. If all succeed, the AsyncAND will
    fire. If one fails, that Failure will be propagated to the AsyncAND. If
    multiple ones fail, the first Failure will go to the AsyncAND and the
    rest will be left unhandled (and therefore logged).
