    """Establish (and maintain) a connection to a given PBURL.

    I establish a connection to the PBURL and run a callback to inform the
    caller about the newly-available RemoteReference. If the connection is
    lost, I schedule a reconnection attempt for the near future. If that one
    fails, I keep trying at longer and longer intervals (exponential
    backoff).

    My constructor accepts a callback which will be fired each time a
    connection attempt succeeds. This callback is run with the new
    RemoteReference and any additional args/kwargs provided to me. The
    callback should then use rref.notifyOnDisconnect() to get a message when
    the connection goes away. At some point after it goes away, the
    Reconnector will reconnect.

    When you no longer want to maintain this connection, call my
    stopConnecting() method. I promise to not invoke your callback after
    you've called stopConnecting(), even if there was already a connection
    attempt in progress. If you had an active connection before calling
    stopConnecting(), you will still have access to it, until it breaks on
    its own. (I will not attempt to break existing connections, I will merely
    stop trying to create new ones).
