class Negotiation(protocol.Protocol):
    """This is the first protocol to speak over the wire. It is responsible
    for negotiating the connection parameters, then switching the connection
    over to the actual Banana protocol. This removes all the details of
    negotiation from Banana, and makes it easier to use a more complex scheme
    (including a STARTTLS transition) in PB.

    Negotiation consists of three phases. In the PLAINTEXT phase, the client
    side (i.e. the one which initiated the connection) sends an
    HTTP-compatible GET request for the target Tub ID. This request includes
    an Connection: Upgrade header. The GET request serves a couple of
    purposes: if a PB client is accidentally pointed at an HTTP server, it
    will trigger a sensible 404 Error instead of getting confused. A regular
    HTTP server can be used to send back a 303 Redirect, allowing Apache (or
    whatever) to be used as a redirection server.

    After sending the GET request, the client waits for the server to send a
    101 Switching Protocols command, then starts the TLS session. It may also
    receive a 303 Redirect command, in which case it drops the connection and
    tries again with the new target.

    In the PLAINTEXT phase, the server side (i.e. the one which accepted the
    connection) waits for the client's GET request, extracts the TubID from
    the first line, consults the local Listener object to locate the
    appropriate Tub (and its certificate), sends back a 101 Switching
    Protocols response, then starts the TLS session with the Tub's
    certificate. If the Listener reports that the requested Tub is listening
    elsewhere, the server sends back a 303 Redirect instead, and then drops
    the connection.

    By the end of the PLAINTEXT phase, both ends know which Tub they are
    using (self.tub has been set).

    Both sides send a Hello Block upon entering the ENCRYPTED phase, which in
    practice means just after starting the TLS session. The Hello block
    contains the negotiation offer, as a series of Key: Value lines separated
    by \\r\\n delimiters and terminated by a blank line. Upon receiving the
    other end's Hello block, each side switches to the DECIDING phase, and
    then evaluates the received Hello message.

    Each side compares TubIDs, and the side with the lexicographically higher
    value becomes the Master. (If, for some reason, one side does not claim a
    TubID, its value is treated as None, which always compares *less* than
    any actual TubID, so the non-TubID side will probably not be the Master.
    Any possible ties are resolved by having the server side be the master).
    Both sides know the other's TubID, so both sides know whether they are
    the Master or not.

    The Master has two jobs to do. The first is that it compares the
    negotiation offer against its own capabilities, and comes to a decision
    about what the connection parameters shall be. It may decide that the two
    sides are not compatible, in which case it will abandon the connection.
    The second job is to decide whether to continue to use the connection at
    all: if the Master already has a connection to the other Tub, it will
    drop this new one. This decision must be made by the Master (as opposed
    to the Server) because it is possible for both Tubs to connect to each
    other simultaneously, and this design avoids a race condition that could
    otherwise drop *both* connections.

    If the Master decides to continue with the connection, it sends the
    Decision block to the non-master side. It then swaps out the Negotiation
    protocol for a new Banana protocol instance that has been created with
    the same parameters that were used to create the Decision block.

    The non-master side is waiting in the DECIDING phase for this block. Upon
    receiving it, the non-master side evaluates the connection parameters and
    either drops the connection or swaps in a new Banana protocol instance
    with the same parameters. At this point, negotiation is complete and the
    Negotiation instances are dropped.


    @ivar negotationOffer: a dict which describes what we will offer to the
    far side. Each key/value pair will be put into a rfc822-style header and
    sent from the client to the server when the connection is established. On
    the server side, handleNegotiation() uses negotationOffer to indicate
    what we are locally capable of.

    Subclasses may influence the negotiation process by modifying this
    dictionary before connectionMade() is called.

    @ivar negotiationResults: a dict which describes what the two ends have
    agreed upon. This is computed by the server, stored locally, and sent
    down to the client. The client receives it and stores it without
    modification (server chooses).

    In general, the negotiationResults are the same on both sides of the same
    connection. However there may be certain parameters which are sent as
    part of the negotiation block (the PB TubID, for example) which will not.
