Welcome to Foolscap's documentation!
====================================
"Foolscap" is an RPC protocol for Python+Twisted, providing a capability-based security model and flexible serialization. It is intended to replace Twisted's native "Perspective Broker" RPC system. Foolscap has been under development (on and off) by Brian Warner for several years.
