    RemoteReference objects should all be tagged with interfaces that they
    implement, which point to representations of the method schemas. When a
    remote method is called, Foolscap should look up the appropriate method and
    serialize the argument list accordingly.
    
    We plan to eliminate positional arguments, so local RemoteReferences use
    their schema to convert callRemote calls with positional arguments to
    all-keyword arguments before serialization.
    
    Conversion to the appropriate version interface should be handled at the
    application level.  Eventually, with careful use of twisted.python.context,
    we might be able to provide automated tools for helping application authors
    automatically convert interface calls and isolate version-conversion code,
    but that is probably pretty hard.

    Common banana sequences:
    
    A reference to a remote object.
       (On the sending side: Referenceable or ReferenceTo(aRemoteable)
        On the receiving side: RemoteReference)
    ('remote', reference-id, interface, version, interface, version, ...)
    
    
    A call to a remote method:
    ('fastcall', request-id, reference-id,
     method-name, 'arg-name', arg1, 'arg-name', arg2)
    
    A call to a remote method with extra spicy metadata:
    ('call', request-id, reference-id, interface,
     version, method-name, 'arg-name', arg1, 'arg-name', arg2)
    
    Special hack: request-id of 0 means 'do not answer this call, do not
    acknowledge', etc.
    
    Answer to a method call:
    ('answer', request-id, response)
    ('error', request-id, response)
    
    Decrement a reference incremented by 'remote' command:
    ('decref', reference-id)
    
    Broker currently has 9 proto_ methods:
    
    _version(vnum): accept a version number, compare to ours, reject if different
    
    _didNotUnderstand(command): log command, maybe drop connection
    
    _message(reqID, objID, message, answerRequired, netArgs, netKw):
    _cachemessage (like _message but finds objID with self.cachedLocallyAs instead
                   of self.localObjectForID, used by RemoteCacheMethod and
                   RemoteCacheObserver)
     look up objID, invoke it with .remoteMessageReceived(message, args),
     send "answer"(reqID, results)
    
    _answer(reqID, results): look up self.waitingForAnswers[reqID] and fire
                             callback with results
    
    _error(reqID, failure): lookup waitingForAnswers, fire errback
    
    _decref(objID): dec refcount of self.localObjects[objID]. Sent in
                    RemoteReference.__del__
    
    _decache(objID): dec refcount of self.remotelyCachedObjects[objID]
    
    _uncache(objID): remove obj from self.locallyCachedObjects[objID]
    





stuff
-----



A RemoteReference/RemoteCopy (called a Remote for now) has a schema
attached to it. remote.callRemote(methodname, *args) does
schema.getMethodSchema(methodname) to obtain a MethodConstraint that
describes the individual method. This MethodConstraint (or MethodSchema) has
other attributes which are used by either end: what arguments are allowed
and/or expected, calling conventions (synchronous, in-order, priority, etc),
and how the return value should be constrained.




To use the Remote like a RemoteCopy ...





::

    
    
    Remote:
     .methods
     .attributes
     .getMethodSchema(methodname) -> MethodConstraint
     .getAttributeSchema(attrname) -> a Constraint
    
    XPCOM idl specifies methods and attributes (readonly, readwrite). A Remote
    object which represented a distant XPCOM object would have a Schema that is
    created by parsing the IDL. Its callRemote would do the appropriate
    marshalling. Issue1: XPCOM lets methods have in/out/inout parameters.. these
    must be detected and a wrapper generated. Issue2: what about attribute
    set/get operations? Could add setRemote and getRemote for these.
    
    ---
    
    Some of the schema questions come down to how PBRootSlicer should deal with
    instances. The question is whether to treat the instance as a Referenceable
    (copy-by-reference: create and transmit a reference number, which will be
    turned into a RemoteReference on the other end), or as a Copyable
    (copy-by-value: collect some instance state and send it as an instance).
    This decision could be made by looking at what the instance inherits from:
    
      if isinstance(obj, pb.Referenceable):
          sendByReference(obj)
      elif isinstance(obj, pb.Copyable):
          sendByValue(obj)
      else:
          raise InsecureJellyError
    
    or by what it can be adapted to:
    
      r = IReferenceable(obj, None)
      if r:
          sendByReference(r)
      else:
          r = ICopyable(obj, None)
          if r:
              sendByValue(r)
          else:
              raise InsecureJellyError
    
    The decision could also be influenced by the sending schema currently in
    effect. Side A invokes a method on side B. A knows of a schema which states
    that the 'foo' argument of this method should be a CopyableSpam, so it
    requires the object be adaptable to ICopyableSpam (which is then copied by
    value) tries to comply when that argument is serialized. B will enforce its
    own schema. When B returns a result to A, the method-result schema on B's
    side can influence how the return value is handled.
    
    For bonus points, it may be possible to send the object as a combination of
    these two. That may get pretty hard to follow, though.
    





adapters and Referenceable/Copyable
-----------------------------------



One possibility: rather than using a SlicerRegistry, use Adapters. The
ISliceable interface has one method: getSlicer(). Slicer.py would register
adapters for basic types (list, dict, etc) that would just return an
appropriate ListSlicer, etc. Instances which would have been pb.Copyable
subclasses in oldpb can still inherit from pb.Copyable, which now implements
ISliceable and produces a Slicer (opentype='instance') that calls
getStateToCopy() (although the subclass-__implements__ handling is now more
important than before). pb.Referenceable implements ISlicer and produces a
Slicer (opentype='reference'?) which (possibly) registers itself in the
broker and then sends the reference number (along with a schema if necessary
(and the other end wants them)).




Classes are also welcome to implement ISlicer themselves and produce
whatever clever (streaming?) Slicer objects they like.




On the receiving side, we still need a registry to provide reasonable
security. There are two registries. The first is the
RootUnslicer.openRegistry, and maps OPEN types to Unslicer factories. It is
used in doOpen().




The second registry should map opentype=instance class names to something
which can handle the instance contents. Should this be a replacement
Unslicer?
